# D&D Tools

This sets up a live d&d/pathfinder python environment from which a game may be
run using a variety of tools to make things simpler.

# Using the Tools

Using the tools provided by this repository may be done by starting up an
interactive python3 session and importing the various packages defined in the
`dnd` module namespace. For ease of use, convenience functions and variables
as well as common imports can be placed in `env.py` and imported into the
interactive session by `from env import *`.
